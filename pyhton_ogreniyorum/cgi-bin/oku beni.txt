From the http.server docs:

CGIHTTPRequestHandler can be enabled in the command line by passing the --cgi option:
$ python3 -m http.server --bind localhost --cgi 8000
Put your script into cgi_directories:

This defaults to ['/cgi-bin', '/htbin'] and describes directories to treat as containing CGI scripts.
Open in the browser:

$ python -mwebbrowser http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/hello.py
where hello.py:

#!/usr/bin/env python
print("Content-Type: text/plain\n")
print("hello")
I had to make it executable on POSIX: chmod +x cgi-bin/hello.py.
